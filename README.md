# SAGE
Sexuality and Gender Equality
SAGE aims in helping the people of the LGBTQ community as well as the other people in the society to break away from the stereotypes that binds them. 
This website includes a divison where people can share their pride story of how they came out of the closet and hence inspire others to do the same and make wise decisions so that they do not have to be afraid to hide their identity. It also aims at educating people regarding the same.
